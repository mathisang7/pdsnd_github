#### US-Bikeshare-Data Analysis
Udacity Programming for Data Science nano degree program - Project 2.

## Overview of the project
In this project, I have analyzed data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Software requirements?
To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:
- Python 
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom
- A terminal application

## The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:
- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year
